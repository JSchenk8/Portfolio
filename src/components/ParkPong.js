              <p>Park Pong was a week long project built using the MERN stack, where I worked with a group of three others to create a crowd-sourced public ping pong table sharing app. </p><br />
              <p>Users can view a map of ping pong tables free to use, check out events happening at different locations, and see the users registered on the page. </p><br />
              <p>Then, if they want to, they can create their own profiles, add new locations and events, comment on other peopleâ€™s events, click to attend them and comment on locations and write messages on other users message boards. </p><br />
              <p>On the back end, I worked to create all the planning materials, before focusing on the code framework, such as seeding programs and middleware. I then took an interest in writing tests using Mocha and Chai, and made sure we had a complete test suite for the whole back end, which included twenty-nine CRUD operations across fourteen end points. </p><br />
              <p>On the front end I created our register and login page, taking extra time to write error validation for each field to ensure a smooth user journey. I integrated the Cloudinary upload system so users can upload profile pictures. </p><br />
              <p>I then oversaw the global styling of the page, giving it a universal look across all pages. It was styled using the Bulma framework and editing SCSS variables along with some CSS.</p><br />
